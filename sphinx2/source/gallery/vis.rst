Visualization
=============

Woo has a built-in 3d view made for detailed inspection of simulations and seeing what matters. It supportes displacement & rotation scaling, selecting & inspecting objects and many other things.

Force chains
-------------

These are force chains during the cylindrical triaxial test, with scaled (magnified) nodal displacements:

Particle traces
---------------

With configurable coloring, length and export to VTK if needed:

Paraview
--------

While Woo itself concentrates on being a superb simulation tool, the possibility to export to Paraview allows to create beautiful renderings of the scene, which is always useful for presenting the results to the management.
